//  Write a program that can be used to gather statistical data about the number of movies
//  college students see in a month. The program should perform the following steps:
//
//      A)  Ask the user how many students were surveyed. An array of integers with this many
//          elements should then be dynamically allocated.
//      B)  Allow the user to enter the number of movies each student saw into the array.
//      C)  Calculate and display the average, median, and mode of the values entered. (Use the
//          functions you wrote in Programming Challenges 8 and 9 to calculate the median and
//          mode.)
//
//  Input Validation: Do not accept negative numbers for input.
